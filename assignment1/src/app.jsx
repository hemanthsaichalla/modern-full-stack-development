                  automated testing and debugging code. Fluent in English with excellent communication and interpersonal skills.
				  A fast learner with strong time management and problem-solving skills. The idea behind taking this course is, 
				  my undergrad has laid a foundation in web technology fundamentals and now it's the interest to dwell deeper into the concepts has made me choose this course.
			      I believe I have a decent knowledge in web concepts and by the end of this course I could get expertise in the MERN.</p>
